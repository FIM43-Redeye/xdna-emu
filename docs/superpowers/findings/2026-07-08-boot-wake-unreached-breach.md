# Boot-to-idle: the wake mechanism is provably UNREACHED (breach reopened)

**Date:** 2026-07-08
**Issue:** #140 firmware-emulation dream / boot-to-idle.
**Branch:** `feat/m2c-mapping-boot-to-idle`.
**Status:** Active. Reopens the boot wall that was banked 2026-07-08 as
"array-gated, not derivable from firmware alone" -- that banking was *imprecise*
and abandoned a live thread. This finding replaces the vague wall with a sharp,
binary, answerable question.

## Why this was reopened

Every recent emulator arc (timer-sync cold-start, send-cadence, the 8000 mailbox
constant, firmware runtime wiring) dead-ends at the same boot-completion wall. We
kept working *around* it. The banked conclusion ("the completion contract lives
in the array's behavior, not derivable from firmware alone") turned out to
contradict the firmware arc's OWN annotation map, which flags the gate-flag
setter as **"still-unidentified (14 disp-0x6c store sites)"** -- i.e. the trace
was abandoned mid-way, then rationalized into a wall. Decision (Maya): drill
*through* it.

## The measured result (decisive)

`m2c_probe_addr_store_watch` on the two wake-state words across **1.5M boot
instructions** (normal boot, no forcing):

| watched addr | meaning | writes in boot |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| `0x22bc` (`[SCHED 0x2250 + 0x6c]`) | scheduler event-pending bitmask | **0** |
| `0x10f40` (`[task 0x10f10 + 0x30]`) | task 0x10f10's pending flag | **0** |

**Neither is ever written.** The wake mechanism is not mis-sequenced or
mis-timed -- the code that completes task `0x10f10` simply never runs in
reachable boot. `force_done` (a direct write of `[0x10f40]=1`) advances boot
58k -> 623k, proving the entire downstream is intact; only the *origin* is
missing.

## The structural lock

Task `0x10f10`'s run-fn is `0x588c` = `sched_event_poll` (`FUN_00005580+0x30c`;
polls event source `0x27010d28`, builds a mask, calls `wake_tasks_by_event_mask`).
Its await-mask `[task+0x38]` is **0**. The waker skips any task where
`delivered & [task+0x38] == 0`, so `0x10f10` is **structurally un-wakeable by the
event system**. Its flag must be set by a *direct* write -- exactly what
`force_done` does and what nothing in boot does.

## Candidate setters (static, disp-0x6c = writes to `[base+0x6c]`)

14 sites total. Known consumers: `deliver_pending_events+0x19` (`0xcaf5`),
`wake_tasks_by_event_mask+0x2b` (`0xd877`). Scheduler-cluster candidates: `0xc9dc`,
`0xcb38`, `0xcf5c`, `0xd134`, `0xd21c`, `0xd53c`. Stack-local (base a1, likely not
`0x22bc`): `0x5e30`, `0x34ef8+0x246`, `0x37218`. Init-region: `0x3fb8`, `0x9ce0`,
`0xc3f8`. **Two sites (`0x34ef8`, `0x37218`) sit in the dormant AIE2 DMA-HAL
region** (`_XAieMl_Dma*`, ops table `0x35004..0x35048` built by `FUN_0000b5d4`),
independently corroborating Session-9's "the real fw installs+calls the DMA HAL
in its own bring-up; EMU diverges by not doing so."

## Sibling pin: the Wall-C column index

Past the 58k wall (via forced completion), the 623k abort is `FUN_00007fa0`'s
`Bgeui a7,6 -> j.`. Traced (`m2c_probe_col_cmd_trace`): the column index is read
from `[0x10f18]` = `[task 0x10f10 + 8]` and holds `0xff` (the unassigned sentinel
set at task init by `FUN_00004570@0x46a9`). It flows into the descriptor at
`0xfae0` (`{opcode=0xf, target-task=0x9140, col-idx=0xff}`) -> the gate's `a7` ->
abort. **Caveat:** the `0xff` is partly a *forcing artifact* -- the probe writes
`[task+0x30]` but not `[task+8]`, whereas the real completion agent plausibly
writes both together (matches Session-7 "event supplied without the powered-column
STATE").

## The question that remains (binary, answerable)

Is task `0x10f10`'s completion produced by:

- **(A) Divergence** -- firmware setup code (arming its await-mask, or the DMA-HAL
  bring-up that would generate the event) that our interp fails to reach due to a
  wrong branch / missing side-effect. Outcome: **fix the interp, boot advances,
  zero new modeling.** Strongest lead, corroborated twice (DMA-HAL dormant).
- **(B) External** -- a hardware agent (SMU/PSP/array) writes `[task+0x30]`
  (and `[task+8]`) directly. Outcome: **model the exact minimal contract**, now
  fully pinned by the above.

## Next pull

Trace `0x10f10`'s full lifecycle: who spawns it, and what code *should* arm its
await-mask `[task+0x38]` (or directly complete it) -- and why boot never reaches
that code. That settles (A) vs (B).

## BREACH RESULT (same session): the contract lever works

Determination is **(B) external**, contract pinned. Evidence the completion is
handed to an external consumer: the descriptor at `0xfae0` is **cache-flushed
(`Dhwbi`)** to shared memory by the builder before the gate `FUN_00007fa0`
submits it; the gate's submit path calls only firmware-internal functions (no
`0x27xxxxxx` MMIO write). `colmask=0xf` = ungate all 4 Phoenix columns
(SMU/PSP, per Session-6).

**Decisive experiment (`m2c_probe_colassign_boot`, new):** every prior force-done
set only `[task+0x30]` and hit Wall C because `[task+8]` stayed `0xff`. Setting
**both** `[task+0x30]=1` AND `[task+8]=col 0` for the worker at the dispatcher
done-check (`0xd828`, fires once at n=47896) **cleared Wall C**: boot then ran the
full 3M-instruction budget with **no abort, no `Unknown`, no spin** (vs the old
58k wedge / 623k abort). The pinned contract -- flag + valid column, together --
is the lever nobody had pulled.

Trajectory note: `max_pc=0x2000e6f2` and a `0x2000_0000` region in the PC
histogram are a **benign low-memory alias** (Harvard overlay), reached at n=1025
during normal early boot -- not a crash.

**Alive/idle drill (same session): NOT idle yet -- one more gate.** After the
worker completes, over the full 3M budget: **min INTLEVEL = 2** (never 0, i.e.
never receive-ready idle) and the **FW_ALIVE magic `0x55504e5f` is never stored**.
So the breach clears Wall C but boot settles into a *further* INTLEVEL-2 stall
short of alive+idle. The multi-wall chain is real: **two walls down (58k
pending-flag, 623k Wall-C column), >=1 more to go.** Likely-next lead: the
descriptor's `target-task=0x9140` and whitelist task `0x9040` (which never parked
this run) -- a second worker completion. **Next drill:** find the third gate the
same way -- what state the post-Wall-C boot now waits on (which task parks, at
what flag), and whether the same flag+column contract clears it.
